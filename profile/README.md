## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are developers in the Warframe Community. We have no affiliation or association with Digital Extremes at time of writing, but we wouldn't mind deeper convos of them.

WFCD has a long history, going back to the first few years of the game's existence, writing tools, conveniences, data, and documentation.

Some of our halmarks can be found in our pinned repositories below.

All of our work, up to this point, is open source, even our [API](https://github.com/wfcd/warframe-status) that we feed data for Genesis, Warframe Hub, and numerous tools created and maintained by others in the community.

### Contact Us

We have a public email @ devs@warframestat.us, a discord at https://warframestat.us/discord or https://discord.gg/jGZxH9f

There's a patreon that one dev (Tobiah) runs at https://patreon.com/cephalongenesis to cover hosting costs on the API, genesis, and other self-hosted services, like the hosting costs for Warframe Hub.

### Projects

We have a listing of projects we support in our [banner](https://github.com/WFCD/banner/blob/main/PROJECTS.md) repo.

### Joining?

Got a project that you think would be a good fit for maintenance here or a project idea you'd like to see happen? Talk to us about it on discord.
