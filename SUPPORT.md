# Support

You can find most, if not all, of the community developers [on discord](https://discord.gg/jGZxH9f), where you're welcome to come and ask questions about projects, prod us about our process, or just chat and get info about things!

We also support issues for bug reports, feature requests, or just ideas to make the project better.
